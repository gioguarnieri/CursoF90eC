# Summary


This two-day introductory course (4 hours total) is designed for programmers already proficient in **Python** and **R** who wish to expand their skills into lower-level languages: **C** and **Fortran 90 (F90)**. By exploring these languages, participants will gain critical insights into computational processes—such as memory management, function execution, and data structure implementation—that underlie high-level operations in Python (e.g., list creation or function calls). This knowledge is essential for optimizing code performance and understanding how software interacts with hardware.

The course combines concise lectures with **interactive coding exercises** and **hands-on practice sessions**. Topics are structured to build progressively, reinforcing concepts through real-world examples and problem-solving activities. Participants will:

- Compare Python/R abstractions with C/F90 implementations;
    
- Write and debug low-level code to optimize common tasks.

This course can be accessed via Obsidian, a helpful note taking tool.
